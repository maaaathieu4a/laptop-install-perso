#PRESENTATION


Pre-requisite : a working network connection and git to clone this repository

#Intended way of working
Any intended change should be done within playbooks here and then applied
The playbooks setup a shortcut to apply changes

#ROADMAP
TODO : how to configure wifi, need a dialogue to ask for password
TODO : use a Makefile for fun : runs the pre-requisite stuff with sudo then runs the playbook
TODO : should dotfiles be included here then?
